# üê± Meow Attack Simulation & Expansion

![Meow Attack](assets/Meow_Attack_Visual.png)

Welcome to the **Meow Attack Simulation & Expansion** repository! This project builds upon my blog post: [Feline Hackers Among Us: A Deep Dive and Simulation of the Meow Attack](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/feline-hackers-among-us-a-deep-dive-and-simulation-of-the-meow-attack/). 

This repository serves as an experimental playground where I make improvements, extend my original research, and provide additional tools for understanding the **Meow Attack** and similar database-targeting threats.

## üöÄ What is the Meow Attack?
The **Meow Attack** is an automated, destructive cyberattack that randomly overwrites unsecured databases exposed to the internet. This attack leaves behind no ransom notes‚Äîjust chaos, and a simple tag: `-MEOW`.

The original research was conducted specifically on **MongoDB**, but this repository aims to **expand the attack surface** to explore **other affected databases**, including **Elasticsearch** and similar technologies that have been targeted by real-world Meow Attacks. By doing so, we can better understand the scope of the attack and how to defend against it.

---

## üî• Features & Goals
- **Simulated Meow Attack Script** ‚Äì A controlled script to demonstrate the attack's effects on a test database.
- **Expansion to Other Affected Databases** ‚Äì Going beyond MongoDB to include **Elasticsearch** and other common targets.
- **Security Enhancements** ‚Äì Suggestions and configurations to prevent similar attacks.
- **Future Expansions** ‚Äì Additional tools, variations of the attack simulation, and defensive countermeasures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **MongoDB** installed and running on a test machine (eg. Docker, VM, Cloud, etc).
- **Python 3.x** with required dependencies (`pymongo`).
- A **controlled, isolated environment** to safely execute scripts.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/meow-attack-simulation.git
   cd meow-attack-simulation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the simulation script:
   ```sh
   python meow_attack.py
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Measures
After running the simulation, it's crucial to understand **how to protect against such attacks**. Some recommended steps:
- **Never expose databases to the public internet** unless absolutely necessary.
- **Use strong authentication & access controls** for all database connections.
- **Enable logging & monitoring** to detect unusual activity.
- **Regularly backup your databases** to recover from potential attacks.
