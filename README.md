# üö® IMPORTANT UPDATE: Meow Attack Tool is Now in a New Repository! üö®  

The **Meow Attack project has evolved!** While this repository started as a research-based simulation of the Meow Attack, it has since grown into a **fully developed cybersecurity tool**. To support further expansion and modularity, the **Meow Attack Tool** has been moved to its own dedicated repository:  

‚û°Ô∏è **[Meow Attack Tool Repository](https://github.com/karlvbiron/Meow-Attack-Tool)**  

This repository remains available as an archive of the original **Meow Attack Simulation**, but for **active development, new features, and future updates**, please check out the new tool.

# üê± Meow Attack Simulation & Expansion  

![Meow Attack](assets/Meow_Attack_Visual.png)  

Welcome to the **Meow Attack Simulation & Expansion** repository! This project builds upon my blog post:  
üìñ **[Feline Hackers Among Us: A Deep Dive and Simulation of the Meow Attack](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/feline-hackers-among-us-a-deep-dive-and-simulation-of-the-meow-attack/)**  

This repository serves as an **experimental playground** where I make improvements, extend my original research, and provide additional tools for understanding the **Meow Attack** and similar database-targeting threats.

## üöÄ What is the Meow Attack?  
The **Meow Attack** is an automated, destructive cyberattack that randomly overwrites unsecured databases exposed to the internet. This attack leaves behind no ransom notes‚Äîjust chaos, and a simple tag: `-MEOW`.  

The original research was conducted specifically on **MongoDB**, but this repository aimed to **expand the attack surface** to explore **other affected databases**, including **Elasticsearch** and similar technologies that have been targeted by real-world Meow Attacks. By doing so, we can better understand the scope of the attack and how to defend against it.  

üö® **However, for an expanded and actively maintained version of this project, check out the** [Meow Attack Tool](https://github.com/karlvbiron/Meow-Attack-Tool).

## üî• Features & Goals  
- **Simulated Meow Attack Script** ‚Äì A controlled script to demonstrate the attack's effects on a test database.  
- **Expansion to Other Affected Databases** ‚Äì Going beyond MongoDB to include **Elasticsearch** and other common targets.  
- **Security Enhancements** ‚Äì Suggestions and configurations to prevent similar attacks.  
- **Future Expansions** ‚Äì Additional tools, variations of the attack simulation, and defensive countermeasures.  

üìå **Now integrated into the Meow Attack Tool!** See [Meow Attack Tool](https://github.com/karlvbiron/Meow-Attack-Tool) for further development.
